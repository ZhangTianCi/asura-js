# asura-js
The "Asura" project is a philosophy and a series of reflections on the project development system.

I hope to find more people who agree with the concept of "Ashura".

"asura-js" is only part of it.

"asura-js" is based on ES6. 

now, i will start modules:

1. File : a tool for "html input file".

2. Upload : to upload File to server , can auto slice by simple conifg. and also, can manual upload by config or function() . I think , it can't run on IE6/IE7 and others , because , "asura" is future , not only "code".

3. Array groupBy , in many project , we use java/C#/Python.... and js/jQuery/Vue... and Chart/Table/List... ,a important question is  DataFormat , in js using, no DataFormat tool (maybe it exist ,but i don't know,so sorry) .so i want develop a simple tool , make we can use the basic function "GroupBy" , to run basic DataFormat conver.
